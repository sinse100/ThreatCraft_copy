# STATUS

## Badges Applied For

We apply for the following artifact badges:

- Artifacts Available
- Artifacts Functional
- Artifacts Reusable

## Justification for Artifacts Available

ThreatCraft is publicly available as a source-code artifact through the project repository. The repository includes the source code, example input files, threat libraries, example outputs, documentation, and license information required to inspect and evaluate the artifact.

## Justification for Artifacts Functional

ThreatCraft can be executed locally as a Python-based GUI application. The artifact provides the core functionality described in the paper, including DFD loading, rule-based attack path generation, attack graph rendering, and LLM-based attack scenario generation and refinement.

The repository also provides example files that can be used to test the tool and check whether the artifact runs correctly in the local environment.

## Justification for Artifacts Reusable

ThreatCraft is organized as a reusable software artifact. Its source code, example files, and domain-specific threat libraries are provided in a structured form, allowing future users to inspect, modify, and extend the artifact.

The threat libraries and example inputs can be adapted to additional domains or case studies. Therefore, the artifact can support further research and practical use beyond the evaluation cases described in the paper.

## Limitations

ThreatCraft is currently provided as a source-code artifact and is not packaged as a Docker image or virtual machine image.

The LLM-based functionality requires valid GPT and Gemini API keys. These API keys are not included in the public repository.
